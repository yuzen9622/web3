# Introduction to Web Technology

This website serves as an **educational platform introducing modern web technologies**, covering both frontend and backend development, as well as CI/CD practices. It provides an overview of essential tools and frameworks used in the creation and deployment of modern websites and web applications.

## 🌐 Overview

The content is organized into several sections to help learners understand how websites are built and maintained:

### 1️⃣ Frontend Technologies

> The technologies that handle the visual and interactive part of the website.

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of a webpage.
- **CSS**: Handles the visual styling and layout of content.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
- **Frontend Frameworks**:
  - **React.js** – A component-based UI library developed by Facebook.
  - **Vue.js** – A progressive JavaScript framework that is beginner-friendly.
  - **Angular** – A comprehensive framework maintained by Google for building enterprise-level apps.

### 2️⃣ Backend Technologies

> These run on the server side and manage logic, data, and APIs.

- **PHP(Laravel)**: A widely-used scripting language, often used in CMS like WordPress.
- **Java(Spring Boot)**: A powerful, object-oriented language, popular in enterprise backends.
- **Node.js(Express.js)**: Enables server-side development using JavaScript.

### 3️⃣ Databases

> Used for storing, retrieving, and managing data.

- **Relational Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL – use structured tables and SQL.
- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB – flexible schema, good for JSON-like data.

### 5️⃣ DevOps & CI/CD

> Ensures smoother development, deployment, and collaboration processes.

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automated testing and building (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
